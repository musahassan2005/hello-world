Hi Humans:

You are to be abducted by 99999999909999 aliens from another dimension!!! Guard yourselves with leaves and paper.
You need a lot of food and water to survive. I am one of those aliens. Don't leave you phones behind, because
we use them as ammo, and your lava and java will be used as food and schoolrooms. We are miniature creatures-
actually we are microscopic but can expand at will. Have a nice day!!
